                <h2>Why study at Seattle Central Community College?</h2>
                <p> Since i moved to USA in 2012, I try a lot of time to start over again my new life at here. But after couple time attempte to apply the jobs here, seattle, I observe that without diploma is so diffult to find a jobs here, even we know how to do it, the employer won't give me a chance to proved my talent at all. Or maybe my english is not good? This question i always ask myself. So, i decided to come to school in hoping to get the diploma and try to get a job that I like.
                </p>
                <h2>Why Web development?</h2>
                <p>Since 2006, I alway research and try to build the application with the VB6 and VB.NET, even no one use my application, but I still do it. Till one day I ask my friend to help me to build a website or to create a database for me, because I want try to build a application online. But as the result he told me that he can't help me without pay him. So That's how i become a web developper from 2012 till now. From time by time, I started to love Web develoment. So now, I become a web developper and also we hoster.
